							That experience fuels his drive to help others through engineering and healthcare.
							He's actively involved in ToysForJoy, a student-led organization that supports children with
							medical needs. Anuj handles the financial operations — tracking expenses, managing supplies,
							and building relationships with companies, fundraisers, and local groups to expand the
							organization's reach. His work reflects a bigger goal: to combine technical skill with
							empathy and make a meaningful impact in people's lives.
